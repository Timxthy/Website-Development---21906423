    <header> JH NETS DEBUT!</header>

    James Harden made a rememerable first impression in his debut with the Brooklyn Nets Org.
<br>
    In fact, Harden made history, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a 30-point triple-double in a team debut.
    <br>
    Harden finished with 32 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds in Brookyln’s 122-115 victory over the Orlando Magic. The 14 assists were a franchise record for a player making his Nets debut.
    <br>
    Amazingly, Harden didn’t score until making a pair of free throws with 6.8 seconds left in the first quarter and didn’t make his first basket until a layup with 10:07 remaining in the half. 
    But his playmaking was on track from the start, pushing up the floor to find teammates rather than often dribbling down the shot clock in Houston.
    <br>
    Harden is the seventh player in NBA history to record a triple-double in his first game with a team.

    <header>Kyrie Still Missing?</header>

    Kyrie Irving, Point Guard of the Brooklyn Nets Organisation.
  <br>

    The Nets listed Irving as out for "personal reasons" on injury reports from Jan. 7 through Jan. 13 and used the "health and safety protocols" designation from Jan. 16 through Jan. 18 after the NBA determined he had violated COVID-19 guidelines by attending a private indoor party. 
    <br>
    Irving was fined $50,000 and forced to forfeit salary for the two games he missed during his five-day quarantine period.
In his first media availability since he rejoined the team, Irving said he had a lot of "family and personal stuff going on" but declined to offer any more details on why he initially missed games.

   As we approach the first year anniversary of Kobe's death, we continue to keep him in our hearts and remember him always.

    
<br >

41-year-old NBA legend was killed along with his daughter Gianna, 13, when a helicopter they were travelling crashed into a hill in thick fog just outside Los Angeles.

Kobe, nicknamed the Black Mamba, was survived by wife Vanessa and his other daughters Natalia, Bianca and Capri, who was born in June 2019.>
